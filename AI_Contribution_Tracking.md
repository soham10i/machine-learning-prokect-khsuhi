# AI Contribution Tracking Protocol

This document outlines the procedures for clearly marking and documenting contributions made by AI assistants (like Jules) to ensure transparency and maintain academic or project integrity.

## 1. Clear Marking of AI-Generated Content

All content generated or significantly modified by an AI assistant must be clearly demarcated. This applies to code, documentation, text, and any other form of deliverable.

### For Code:

*   **New Files Created by AI:**
    *   A header comment block will be included at the beginning of any new code file generated entirely by the AI assistant.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        # ==============================================================================
        # AI GENERATED FILE
        # AI Tool Used: Jules - Google AI Agent
        # Timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC
        # Original Prompt: "Create a Python script to parse CSV data from 'input.csv' and output records older than 30 days to 'output.csv'."
        # Purpose of Generation: To provide a starting script for CSV data processing as per user request.
        # Assumptions Made: Assumes 'input.csv' has a 'date' column in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
        # ==============================================================================

        # ... rest of the AI-generated code ...
        ```

*   **Blocks of Code Inserted into Existing Files:**
    *   Specific comment markers will be used to clearly delineate blocks of code generated by the AI and inserted into pre-existing files.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        # ... existing user code ...

        # AI-GENERATED CODE START
        # AI Tool Used: Jules - Google AI Agent
        # Timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC
        # Original Prompt: "Insert a function here to validate email addresses using regex."
        # Purpose of Generation: To add email validation functionality to the existing script.
        # ---
        def is_valid_email(email):
            # ... AI-generated regex and validation logic ...
            return True # Placeholder
        # AI-GENERATED CODE END

        # ... existing user code ...
        ```

*   **Single-Line Additions or Significant Modifications by AI:**
    *   An inline comment will be added at the end of the line for single-line additions or for lines significantly modified by the AI.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        user_age = current_year - birth_year # MODIFIED BY AI: Jules - Corrected off-by-one error. Prompt: "Review age calculation for errors."
        print(f"User age is: {user_age}") # ADDED BY AI: Jules - Added logging for debugging. Prompt: "Add a print statement for user_age."
        ```

### For Documentation/Text:

*   **New Documents Generated by AI:**
    *   A clear statement will be included at the beginning of any document (e.g., README, reports, design documents) entirely generated by the AI assistant.
    *   **Example:**
        > This document was generated by the AI assistant, Jules, on YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC.
        >
        > **AI Tool Used:** Jules - Google AI Agent
        > **Original Prompt:** "Generate a project README for a Python application that uses Flask and SQLAlchemy."
        > **Purpose of Generation:** To create an initial README file for the project.
        > **Assumptions Made:** Assumed standard project structure and common sections for a README.

*   **AI-Contributed Sections in Larger Documents:**
    *   If the AI assistant contributes specific sections to a larger document primarily authored by a human, these sections will be clearly demarcated. This can be done using a distinct heading, a note, or a callout box.
    *   **Example:**
        > ... user-authored content ...
        >
        > ---
        > **Note: The following section on 'Market Analysis' was generated by AI assistant Jules.**
        > **AI Tool Used:** Jules - Google AI Agent
        > **Timestamp:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC
        > **Original Prompt:** "Provide a brief market analysis for e-commerce solutions in the pet supply industry."
        > **Purpose of Generation:** To draft the market analysis section for the business plan.
        > ---
        >
        > ... AI-generated market analysis content ...
        >
        > ---
        > **End of AI-Generated Section**
        > ---
        >
        > ... user-authored content ...

## 2. Format for Detailing Prompt and Purpose

Alongside any AI-generated content (either directly in comments/text or via a link to a central log for very large contributions), the following details must be provided. This information is crucial for understanding the context, provenance, and potential limitations of the AI's contribution.

*   **`AI Tool Used:`** The specific name and version (if applicable) of the AI tool used (e.g., Jules - Google AI Agent, OpenAI ChatGPT-4, Microsoft Copilot).
*   **`Timestamp:`** The date and time (preferably with timezone, e.g., UTC) when the content was generated. This helps in tracking versions and understanding the context if the AI model or underlying data changes over time.
*   **`Original Prompt:`** The exact prompt or question provided to the AI by the user.
    *   For very long or conversational prompts, a concise summary that captures the essence of the request is acceptable, with a note indicating it's a summary (e.g., "Summary of conversational prompt regarding API error handling strategies.").
    *   If the prompt includes references to specific data or code, this context should be briefly mentioned.
*   **`Purpose of Generation:`** A brief explanation of why this content was generated and what role it plays in the overall project or document (e.g., "To implement the user authentication module as per specification X," "To draft the methodology section for the research paper," "To generate test cases for the factorial function").
*   **`Assumptions Made (if any):`** Any assumptions the AI assistant made while generating the content. This is important for the user to review and verify, as incorrect assumptions can lead to flawed outputs (e.g., "Assumed input data is sanitized," "Assumed Python 3.8+ environment," "Assumed familiarity with agile methodologies for the project plan").
*   **`Modifications by User (if any):`** If the AI-generated content was subsequently modified by the user, a brief note indicating this should be included. For significant modifications, the user may choose to remove the AI-generated markers if the content becomes substantially original.

This information should be easily accessible and directly associated with the generated content to ensure clarity and traceability. For extensive projects, maintaining a central log (e.g., a separate document or a spreadsheet) linked from the AI-generated content might be more practical. Each entry in the log should correspond to a specific AI contribution.

Adherence to this tracking protocol is vital for responsible AI utilization and maintaining transparency in all collaborative efforts involving AI assistants.

## 3. User Verification Reminders

While the AI assistant, Jules, aims to provide accurate and relevant content, the following points are crucial for the user to always keep in mind:

*   **Explicit Reminders:** Jules (the AI assistant) will make it a practice to include explicit reminders for the user to critically review and verify any generated content. This may come in the form of direct statements accompanying the output.
*   **User Responsibility:** It remains the user's sole responsibility to meticulously check, validate, and take ownership of all content, whether AI-generated or AI-assisted, before any formal submission or use.
*   **Nature of AI Output:** AI-generated content should be treated as a draft or a starting point, requiring human oversight and refinement to ensure accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness for the intended purpose.
