# Academic Integrity Protocol

This document outlines the principles and procedures for maintaining academic integrity, particularly concerning the use of AI tools and the prevention of plagiarism. Adherence to this protocol is mandatory for all individuals subject to these academic standards.

## 1. AI Tool Usage Guidelines

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as language models, code generators, and research assistants (e.g., Jules), can be valuable aids in the academic process. However, their use must be transparent and responsible.

*   **AI Tools as Assistants:** AI tools are to be regarded as assistants. They can help with brainstorming, drafting, coding, and information gathering, but they do not replace the user's intellectual engagement and critical thinking.
*   **Critical Review and Verification:** All content generated by AI tools (including but not limited to text, code, data, and images) must be meticulously reviewed, critically evaluated, and thoroughly verified for accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness by the user. The user must understand the AI-generated content as if it were their own original work.
*   **User Responsibility:** The user is solely and ultimately responsible for all submitted work, regardless of the extent to_which AI tools were utilized in its preparation. This includes responsibility for any errors, inaccuracies, or ethical implications arising from the use of AI-generated content.
*   **Disclosure of AI Tool Usage:** Any use of AI-generated content in submitted work must be clearly and explicitly disclosed. This disclosure should include:
    *   The name of the AI tool used (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Jules).
    *   The specific prompt(s) given to the AI tool to generate the content.
    *   A clear description of how and for what purpose the AI-generated content was used in the work.
    This disclosure should be made in a designated section of the submission, such as an appendix, a methodology section, or as instructed by the specific assignment guidelines.

## 2. Plagiarism Prevention Measures

Originality and proper attribution are cornerstones of academic integrity. All submitted work must be the user's own, and any reliance on external sources must be acknowledged appropriately.

*   **Emphasis on Originality:** All submitted work (essays, reports, code, presentations, etc.) is expected to be the original creation of the user, reflecting their own understanding, analysis, and expression.
*   **Proper Citation:** Any external sources used in the creation of academic work must be properly cited. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Direct quotations and paraphrased text.
    *   Ideas, concepts, and arguments derived from others.
    *   Code snippets, algorithms, and programming libraries.
    *   Images, diagrams, charts, and other visual materials.
    *   Data and datasets.
    Citations must follow the prescribed referencing style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE) consistently. Failure to cite sources appropriately constitutes plagiarism.
*   **Use of Plagiarism Detection Tools:** Where available and appropriate, users are encouraged to utilize plagiarism detection software (e.g., Turnitin, Grammarly's plagiarism checker) to review their work before submission. This can help identify any unintentional instances of improper citation or unoriginal content.
*   **Consequences of Unattributed Work:** Submitting work that is not one's own, or that incorporates external material without proper and clear attribution, even with minor modifications, is a serious breach of academic integrity. This includes copying from other students, websites, publications, or any other source without acknowledgment. Such actions will be subject to disciplinary measures as outlined in the relevant academic policies.

By adhering to this Academic Integrity Protocol, users contribute to a fair, honest, and intellectually rigorous academic environment.
